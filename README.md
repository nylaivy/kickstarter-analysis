# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performed analysis on kickstarter data with a sample size of 4114 campaigns to reveal trends for Louise, an upcoming playwright, who wants to fund her up-incoming play with a budget of 10k. Out of all the kickstarter campaigns in the dataset, theater campaigns are the most popular and  approximately 64% of these campaigns were successful.

There is a correlation between the time of year these campaigns are launched and May and June both have the greatest success rate for all kickstarter campaigns. **What about length of a campaign?** On average successfull kickstarter campaigns have a goal of $5,049. Louise is most interested in the Great Britain market and while there are only a total of 604 Kickstarter campaigns in Great Britain, the "theater" category is the most successful. About 70% of successful kickstarter campaigns are theater ones, and 72% of these theater campaigns succeed. When comparing the distribution of campaign goals to the distribution of total amounts pledged for plays specifically in Great Britain, the average campaign goal is around £4,000. Louise should try to get her play produced for less than £4,000 since this is outside of the range of outliers for amounts pledged. **Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile/75% of the amounts pledged.**
